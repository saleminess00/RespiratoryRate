# About
## Overview
Respiratory rates are vital indicators of health used by clinicians in various healthcare settings. They provide valuable insights into the respiratory system's functioning and help diagnose potential abnormalities. However, manual measurement of respiratory rates is time-consuming and prone to inaccuracies. To overcome these limitations, we aim to develop a machine learning-based method for predicting respiratory rates using physiological signals such as ECG, PPG, and impedance pneumography. By leveraging advanced algorithms, we can estimate respiratory rates accurately and in real time, enabling continuous monitoring and early detection of respiratory irregularities.

The ability to predict respiratory rates has significant implications for healthcare. It empowers healthcare providers to continuously monitor patients' respiratory status, even in situations where direct observation is challenging. By accurately forecasting respiratory rates, healthcare teams can promptly identify deviations from normal ranges and initiate appropriate interventions. This proactive approach can prevent adverse events, optimize patient care pathways, and improve outcomes. By harnessing the power of predictive analytics, we can revolutionize respiratory rate assessment, management, and patient care, ultimately enhancing the well-being and safety of individuals in healthcare settings.

##  Features

1. breaths ann1 [signal sample no]: Manual annotations of breaths by the first annotator, indicating the sample numbers corresponding to the start and end of each breath.

2. breaths ann2 [signal sample no]: Manual annotations of breaths by the second annotator, indicating the sample numbers corresponding to the start and end of each breath.

3. HR: Heart rate, derived from the ECG signal (beats per minute).

4. PULSE: Pulse rate, derived from the PPG signal (beats per minute).

5. RESP: Respiratory rate, derived from the impedance respiratory signal (breaths per minute).

6. SpO2: Blood oxygen saturation level, expressed as a percentage.

7. RESP: Impedance respiratory signal.

8. PLETH: Photoplethysmogram (PPG) signal.

9. V: Lead V ECG signal.

10. AVR: Lead AVR ECG signal.

11. II: Lead II ECG signal.

These features represent various physiological parameters and signals recorded during the monitoring of critically-ill patients. They provide valuable information for assessing cardiac and respiratory function.
